### **Repository Description: infokrv-go-server**

`infokrv-go-server` is a lightweight, modular Go-based server implementation designed to handle HTTP requests and provide RESTful APIs. Built with simplicity and scalability in mind, this project serves as a foundation for backend services, offering clean code structure and adherence to Go best practices.

#### **Key Features**
- **RESTful API Design**: The server exposes well-defined endpoints for seamless communication between clients and the backend.
- **Modular Architecture**: Code is organized into logical components (e.g., handlers, models, and services) to ensure maintainability and extensibility.
- **Configuration Management**: Supports environment-based configuration for flexibility across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling with meaningful error messages and structured logging for easier debugging.
- **Middleware Support**: Includes middleware for common tasks like request logging, authentication, and performance monitoring.
- **Scalable and Performant**: Optimized for concurrent processing using Go's goroutines and channels, ensuring high performance under load.

#### **Use Cases**
This repository is ideal for developers looking to:
- Build a RESTful backend service for web or mobile applications.
- Learn Go by exploring a practical, real-world server implementation.
- Prototype APIs quickly with minimal setup.

#### **Technologies Used**
- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Framework**: Built on Go's standard `net/http` package for HTTP handling.
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external libraries to keep the project lightweight and dependency-free where possible.
- **Logging**: Structured logging for better observability and debugging.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and correctness.

#### **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GauravKrv/infokrv-go-server.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
4. Access the API endpoints via `http://localhost:8080`.

#### **Future Enhancements**
- Add support for database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth2).
- Introduce Docker support for containerized deployment.
- Expand test coverage and integrate CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
